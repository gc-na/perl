# Understanding 'untie' in Perl: A Comprehensive Guide

## Synopsis
The `untie` function in Perl is used to detach a tied variable from its associated class, allowing the variable to revert to its normal behavior without the influence of the tie.

## Documentation
### Purpose
In Perl, the `tie` function allows you to bind a variable to a class that can handle operations on that variable in a customized way. The `untie` function serves as the counterpart, enabling you to remove the tie from the variable, thus restoring its default behavior.

### Usage
The basic syntax of the `untie` function is as follows:

```perl
untie VARIABLE;
```

Where `VARIABLE` is the tied variable you wish to untie.

### Details
When a variable is tied, it is associated with a package that implements specific methods to control how the variable behaves. Tying allows for functionalities such as lazy loading, persistent storage, or other customized behaviors. However, there are instances where you may want to stop using the tied behavior and revert to standard variable operations. This is when `untie` comes into play.

#### Important Points
- You can only untie a variable that has been tied; attempting to untie an untied variable will result in a warning.
- The `untie` function operates on scalar, array, and hash variables.
- After calling `untie`, the variable will no longer call the tied methods, and any operations performed on it will use the default behavior.

## Examples
Here are some basic usage examples demonstrating how to use `untie` in Perl:

### Example 1: Untying a Scalar
```perl
use Tie::Scalar;

# Tie a scalar to a class
tie my $scalar, 'Tie::Scalar', 0;

# Work with the tied scalar
$scalar = 100;

# Untie the scalar
untie $scalar;

# Now $scalar behaves like a normal scalar
print $scalar;  # Outputs: 100
```

### Example 2: Untying an Array
```perl
use Tie::Array;

# Tie an array to a class
tie my @array, 'Tie::Array';

# Work with the tied array
push @array, 1, 2, 3;

# Untie the array
untie @array;

# Now @array behaves like a normal array
print scalar @array;  # Outputs: 3
```

### Example 3: Untying a Hash
```perl
use Tie::Hash;

# Tie a hash to a class
tie my %hash, 'Tie::Hash';

# Work with the tied hash
$hash{'key'} = 'value';

# Untie the hash
untie %hash;

# Now %hash behaves like a normal hash
print $hash{'key'};  # Outputs: value
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Warning on Untying Untied Variables**: If you try to untie a variable that has not been tied, Perl will issue a warning. Ensure that the variable is indeed tied before calling `untie`.
- **Tied Variable Scope**: If a variable is declared within a limited scope, untie may not behave as expected, especially if the variable goes out of scope before the untie operation is executed.
- **Loss of Tied Behavior**: After calling `untie`, all methods associated with the tie are lost. If you need to return to the tied behavior, you will need to re-tie the variable.

## One Line Summary
The `untie` function in Perl is used to detach a tied variable from its associated class, restoring its default behavior.
