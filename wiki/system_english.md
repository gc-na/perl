# Perl `system` Function: Execute External Commands from Perl Scripts

## Synopsis
The `system` function in Perl allows developers to execute external system commands or programs directly from a Perl script, returning the exit status of the command.

## Documentation

### Purpose
The `system` function is used to call operating system commands and utilities from within a Perl script. This is particularly useful for automating tasks that require interaction with the underlying operating system, such as file manipulation, process management, or executing compiled programs.

### Usage
The basic syntax of the `system` function is as follows:

```perl
system EXPR;
```

Where `EXPR` can be a string representing the command to execute or a list of strings, where the first element is the command and the remaining elements are its arguments.

### Details
- **Return Value**: The `system` function returns the exit status of the command executed. A successful execution returns `0`, while a non-zero value indicates an error.
- **Exit Codes**: The exit code can be accessed using the special variable `$?`, which contains the status of the last executed command.
- **List Context**: When called in list context, `system` returns the same exit status, but in scalar context, it returns the process ID of the executed command.

## Examples

### Example 1: Basic Command Execution
```perl
my $exit_status = system("ls -l");
if ($exit_status == 0) {
    print "Command executed successfully.\n";
} else {
    print "Command failed with status: $exit_status\n";
}
```

### Example 2: Using Arguments
```perl
my $file = "example.txt";
my $exit_status = system("cat", $file);
if ($exit_status == 0) {
    print "File displayed successfully.\n";
} else {
    print "Failed to display file with status: $exit_status\n";
}
```

### Example 3: Checking Exit Status
```perl
system("nonexistent_command");
if ($? != 0) {
    die "Command failed: $!\n";
}
```

## Explanation

### Common Pitfalls
- **Quoting**: When using a single string, ensure that the command is properly quoted and formatted; otherwise, the command may not execute as expected.
- **Environment Variables**: The command may not have the same environment as the Perl script. If your command relies on certain environment variables, you may need to set them explicitly.
- **Shell vs. Direct Execution**: Using `system` with a string executes the command through the shell, which can lead to unexpected behavior if shell features (like pipes or redirection) are expected. To avoid this, use a list to directly call the command.

### Gotchas
- **Exit Code Interpretation**: The exit status from `$?` needs to be interpreted correctly using bitwise operations (e.g., `($? >> 8)` gives the actual exit code).
- **Blocking Behavior**: The `system` function is blocking; it will not return until the called command has finished executing.

## One Line Summary
The `system` function in Perl provides a method to execute external commands while capturing their exit status for error handling and control flow.
