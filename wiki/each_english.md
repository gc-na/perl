# Understanding the `each` Function in Perl: A Complete Guide

## Synopsis
The `each` function in Perl is a powerful tool used for iterating over hash elements, allowing developers to retrieve key-value pairs in a memory-efficient manner.

## Documentation
The `each` function is primarily used with hashes to iterate through key-value pairs. It returns the next key-value pair in the hash on each call. Once all pairs have been retrieved, subsequent calls will return an empty list.

### Purpose
- To traverse a hash without needing to know the keys in advance.
- To provide a way to access both the key and value during each iteration.

### Usage
```perl
while (my ($key, $value) = each %hash) {
    # Code to process each key-value pair
}
```

### Details
- **Context**: `each` operates in a list context, returning a two-element list (key and value). In a scalar context, it returns the key.
- **Stateful**: The function maintains its state between calls, making it suitable for loop constructs.
- **Empty Hash**: When called on an empty hash, `each` will return an empty list.
- **Resetting**: To restart iteration, one must reset the hash using `keys` or `values`, or reinitialize the hash.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
```perl
my %fruit = (
    apple  => 'red',
    banana => 'yellow',
    grape  => 'purple',
);

while (my ($key, $value) = each %fruit) {
    print "$key is $value\n";
}
```
#### Output:
```
apple is red
banana is yellow
grape is purple
```

### Scalar Context
```perl
my %fruit = (apple => 'red', banana => 'yellow');

while (my $key = each %fruit) {
    print "Processing $key\n";
}
```
#### Output:
```
Processing apple
Processing banana
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Modifying the Hash**: Be cautious when modifying the hash during iteration. Adding or deleting elements can lead to unexpected behavior or infinite loops.
- **Empty Hash**: If an empty hash is passed to `each`, it wonâ€™t yield any elements; ensure the hash is populated before usage.
- **Not Resetting**: If you need to iterate over the hash multiple times, remember that `each` maintains its state. You may need to reset with `keys` or construct a new loop.

### Additional Notes
- **Efficiency**: Using `each` is often more memory-efficient than using other forms of iteration, especially for large hashes.
- **Context Awareness**: The function's behavior changes based on context, which can be a source of confusion for beginners. Always be clear about what context you are working in.

## One Line Summary
The `each` function in Perl provides a stateful method for iterating over hash key-value pairs, enabling efficient data processing.
