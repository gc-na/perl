# Understanding Perl's `unshift`: Adding Elements to the Beginning of an Array

## Synopsis
The `unshift` function in Perl is used to add one or more elements to the beginning of an array. This operation modifies the original array and can be useful for managing lists or queues.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `unshift` function allows you to insert elements at the start of an array, shifting existing elements to the right. This is particularly helpful when you need to maintain a specific order in your data structure.

### Usage
The basic syntax for `unshift` is as follows:

```perl
unshift @array, $element1, $element2, ...;
```

- `@array`: The array to which you want to add elements.
- `$element1`, `$element2`, ...: The elements you want to add at the beginning of the array.

The function returns the new total number of elements in the array after the addition.

### Details
- Elements can be added one at a time or in bulk.
- `unshift` modifies the array in place and does not create a new array.
- If no elements are specified, `unshift` will simply return the count of the elements in the array without modifying it.

## Examples
### Basic Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating the use of `unshift`:

```perl
my @fruits = ('banana', 'orange');
unshift @fruits, 'apple';
print join(", ", @fruits);  # Output: apple, banana, orange
```

### Adding Multiple Elements
You can also add multiple elements in one call:

```perl
my @numbers = (3, 4, 5);
unshift @numbers, 1, 2;
print join(", ", @numbers);  # Output: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
```

### No Elements Added
When using `unshift` with no additional elements:

```perl
my @colors = ('red', 'green', 'blue');
my $count = unshift @colors; 
print $count;  # Output: 3 (no change to @colors)
```

## Explanation
### Common Pitfalls
- **Not using an array**: Ensure you are unshifting into an array. Using it on a non-array variable will result in an error.
- **Empty Array**: If you `unshift` into an empty array, the array will simply contain the new elements without any issues.
- **Performance**: Frequent use of `unshift` on large arrays can lead to performance issues, as it involves shifting all existing elements to new indexes.

### Additional Notes
- `unshift` is part of Perl's built-in array functions, which makes it a convenient choice for array manipulation.
- Consider alternatives like `push` for adding elements at the end of the array if that fits your use case better.

## One Line Summary
`unshift` in Perl is a function that adds one or more elements to the beginning of an array, modifying the original array in place.
