# Perl sqrt Function: Calculating Square Roots in Perl

## Synopsis
The `sqrt` function in Perl is a built-in mathematical function used to compute the square root of a non-negative number. It is a simple yet powerful tool for numerical computations in Perl scripts.

## Documentation
### Purpose
The `sqrt` function is designed to return the square root of a given number. It is particularly useful in mathematical calculations, scientific applications, and data analysis where square root operations are frequently required.

### Usage
The syntax for the `sqrt` function is straightforward:

```perl
my $result = sqrt($number);
```

- **Parameters**: 
  - `$number`: A non-negative number (integer or float) for which the square root is to be calculated.
  
- **Return Value**: 
  - Returns the square root of `$number`. If `$number` is negative, the function will return `NaN` (Not a Number).

### Details
- The `sqrt` function is part of Perl's core functionality and does not require any additional modules to be imported.
- The result of `sqrt` is a floating-point number, and hence it can contain decimal values.
- Performance-wise, `sqrt` is optimized for speed and accuracy, making it suitable for real-time applications.

## Examples
### Basic Usage
Here are a few examples demonstrating how to use the `sqrt` function in Perl:

```perl
# Example 1: Calculate the square root of a positive integer
my $num1 = 16;
my $result1 = sqrt($num1);
print "The square root of $num1 is $result1\n";  # Output: The square root of 16 is 4

# Example 2: Calculate the square root of a float
my $num2 = 20.25;
my $result2 = sqrt($num2);
print "The square root of $num2 is $result2\n";  # Output: The square root of 20.25 is 4.5

# Example 3: Handling negative numbers
my $num3 = -9;
my $result3 = sqrt($num3);
print "The square root of $num3 is $result3\n";  # Output: The square root of -9 is NaN
```

## Explanation
While the `sqrt` function is straightforward, there are a few common pitfalls to avoid:

- **Negative Input**: Providing a negative number to the `sqrt` function will yield `NaN`. It's important to validate your inputs if there's a possibility of negative values being passed.
  
- **Floating-point Precision**: When dealing with very large or very small numbers, be aware of floating-point precision limitations in Perl. Results may not be exact due to how floating-point arithmetic is handled.

- **Performance Considerations**: Although `sqrt` is fast, if used inside loops with a large number of iterations, it could affect performance. Consider caching results when possible.

## One Line Summary
The `sqrt` function in Perl efficiently computes the square root of non-negative numbers, returning `NaN` for negative inputs.
