# getservbyname: Retrieving Service Port Numbers in Perl

## Synopsis
The `getservbyname` function in Perl is used to retrieve the port number and protocol associated with a specific service name. This functionality is essential for network programming when working with services that require standard port numbers, such as HTTP or FTP.

## Documentation
### Purpose
`getservbyname` is a built-in Perl function that queries the system's service database (usually found in `/etc/services` on Unix-like systems) to retrieve information about a network service based on its name and protocol. This function returns the port number associated with the service name and the protocol (TCP or UDP).

### Usage
The basic syntax of the `getservbyname` function is as follows:

```perl
getservbyname(SERVICE_NAME, PROTOCOL);
```

- **SERVICE_NAME**: A string representing the name of the service (e.g., 'http', 'ftp').
- **PROTOCOL**: A string indicating the protocol used by the service ('tcp' or 'udp').

### Return Value
The function returns an integer representing the port number for the specified service and protocol. If the service is not found, `getservbyname` will return `undef`.

### Example
Here is a simple example demonstrating how to use `getservbyname` in Perl:

```perl
use strict;
use warnings;

my $service_name = 'http';
my $protocol = 'tcp';
my $port = getservbyname($service_name, $protocol);

if (defined $port) {
    print "The $service_name service runs on port $port using $protocol protocol.\n";
} else {
    print "Service $service_name not found for protocol $protocol.\n";
}
```

### Explanation
When using `getservbyname`, be aware of the following potential pitfalls:

- **Service Not Found**: If the service name or protocol is incorrect, the function will return `undef`. Always check for this to avoid unexpected behavior in your script.
- **Case Sensitivity**: The service name is typically case-sensitive. Ensure you use the correct casing as defined in the services database.
- **Protocol Specification**: Make sure to specify either 'tcp' or 'udp'. Using an incorrect protocol will result in a failed lookup.
- **Environment Dependency**: The availability of services can vary between different operating systems and configurations. Testing on the target deployment environment is recommended.

## One Line Summary
The `getservbyname` function in Perl retrieves the port number associated with a specified service name and protocol from the system's service database.
